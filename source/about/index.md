### About Me

Hello 👋 I am a software engineer currently actively looking for a job in Canada 🇨🇦. The roles I am looking for include software engineer, machine learning engineer, or even full-stack developer.

In daily life, I love gaming 🎮, music 🎧, and competitive programming 🧠. I enjoy solving problems, thinking through tricky logic, and sometimes just grinding puzzles for fun.


### About This Blog

In this blog, I will mainly post things related to my daily life.

I write about things that I find interesting, mostly competitive programming notes and ideas 💡, gaming stuff 🎮,  or some random thoughts that pop into my head.

Nothing too serious, just sharing what I’m learning, building, or thinking about along the way. 🙂
